PRE-STEPS
Create a folder in your Desktop to store all the .java and .csv files.
Download the Choreographer Conflicts Google sheets in the Board folder as a .csv file. Rename the .csv file to something easy to type (e.g. fall-22)

STEPS
Download all the .java files in this GitHub repository named "Choreographer," "Arc," and "Main" and store them inside your folder.
Open up your terminal.
In the MacOS terminal, type and enter "cd Desktop/name_of_folder" -- so if your folder is named "evo-scheduling," you should type "cd Desktop/evo-scheduling"
In the Windows terminal, type and enter "cd OneDrive/Desktop/name_of_folder" -- so if your folder is named "evo-scheduling," you should type and enter "cd OneDrive/Desktop/evo-scheduling"
Now that you're in the correct directory, you can now run the program!

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
On MacOS and Windows, type and enter "javac Main.java" to compile the .java into a .class
Then, type and enter "java Main" This should prompt you to choose the .csv file. So if your .csv filename is "fall-22," type and enter "fall-22.csv".
This should prompt a second question to choose which algorithm to run. Type and enter "1".
If algorithm 1 does not INITIALLY provide a valid assignment, re-run step 2-3 with the first algorithm at least THREE TIMES. I
If that still does not work, type and enter "2" to run the second algorithm.
If neither algorithm works, good luck! (do it by handdd)
If a valid assignment has been created, feel free to share this draft schedule to the choreographers and change any times that would fit best.
